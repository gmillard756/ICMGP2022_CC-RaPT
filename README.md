# ICMGP2022 Coding Chirality: Using R and Python Together
**No prior coding experience is necessary**

Welcome to our coding workshop that is part of the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant!  This workshop will take place virtually on **July 19th, 2022.**

## Who are we?

**Caitlin Eger** was introduced to R as an undergraduate at Juniata College, and a decade later she focused on data science as part of her graduate coursework in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Syracuse University. She began experimenting with Python in 2018 and now uses both R and Python regularly in her professional life as a data scientist.

**Geoffrey Millard** began using R in 2013 as part of an effort to pick up new skills in graduate school at Syracuse University.  R was a major workhorse of his master's and PhD work examining mercury in fish and freshwater aquatic ecosystems.  R continues to be important skill he uses data compilation, visualization, statistics, and reproducable research.  Geoffrey began using Python in 2019 when Caitlin showed him a cool [beta](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) version of RStudio that combined both languages into a single workflow.

## What are you going to learn?

We are still in the process of finalizing our workshop materials, however, everything will eventually be available from this Github repository.  This workshop aims to help the ICMGP community become more comfortable using R and Python together in the same workflow. You will see hands-on coding demonstrations using real biogeochemical data and gain experience using two popular open-source programming software languages, R and Python.  We will be using these languages together in the same workflow/coding environment, RStudio. This workshop will focus on giving researchers tools to start doing data management, visualization, and analysis, using short modules on:

1) Scraping datasets from the web using an API (either language), 
2) Importing and cleaning datasets (R)
3) An exploratory data analysis (Python), and 
4) Creating plots and maps. 

Participants will engage with a series of coding activities presented in R and Python to give learners a better sense of the unique syntax and characteristics of each language.

## Before the workshop begins 
Make sure you download and install:
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
- and Python [directions](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500007929061-Using-Python-with-the-RStudio-IDE)

**Yes, you will need all of these on your computer.** 

If you can download and run [Pre-workshop_check.Rmd](https://github.com/gmillard756/ICMGP2022_Coding_Chirality/tree/main/Excercises) **in RStudio**, your computer is ready!

It is recommended all attendees complete the pre-workshop activities (*For people with little/no coding experience, there is now an R based [pre-workshop coding exercise](https://gmillard756.github.io/ICMGP2022_Coding_Chirality/Excercises/Intro_to_coding_with_R.html) (30 min) to get familiar with basic principles*). Attendees are encouraged to ask questions during the session.

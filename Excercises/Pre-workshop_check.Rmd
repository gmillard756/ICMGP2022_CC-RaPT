## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Try running the below code chunks by hitting the play button on the right of each chunk.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
data1 <- cars
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # you may be asked to install/update R packages 'png' and 'reticulate' when you do this for the first time.
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
display(r.data1)
```

If you can see a printout in your Console window of speed and dist data, you have R, RStudio and Python installed on your computer.

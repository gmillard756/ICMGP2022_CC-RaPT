## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Try running the below code chunks by hitting the play button on the right of each chunk.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
data1 <- cars
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # you may be asked to install/update R packages 'png' and 'reticulate' when you do this for the first time.
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
display(r.data1)
```

If you can see a printout in your Console window (bottom left in default RStudio layout) of speed and dist data, you have R, RStudio and Python installed on your computer.

Setup errors: There are several types of errors you may receive before your installation setup works properly, here are some of the most common ones:

`Error in library(reticulate) : there is no package called ‘reticulate’`
This type of error appears if you do not have the `reticulate` package loaded in your R package library. Run `install.packages('reticulate')` to download and install the reticulate package.

`Error: unexpected symbol in "import matplotlib.pyplot"`
This type of error appears if you try to run python code in an R console. First you must run the call `library(reticulate)` to load the reticulate package and bind a python version to your R session.

`Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'IPython'`
This type of error appears if a python module is not loaded in your environment. A python module is the equivalent of an R package, it is an auxilliary folder, external to the base R or python distirbution, with extra resources, such as scripts containing special functions, or specialized datasets. In order to download a python module, switch to the `Terminal` tab in RStudio, and run `$ pip install IPython` in the shell.
